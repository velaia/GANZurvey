# GANZurvey

The purpose of this program is to offer a very simple online survey to compare GAN-generated images with one another.

## Original requirements
* images with identical names in subdirectories of the same folder
* images with identical name are compared to each other
* survey participants have to enter their name first
* there's a little text + image introduction to explain the program to the participants at the beginning of the page
* one main page with submit button plus one thank you page

## How it works
